        <ol>
            <li>Welcome to my website! I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to you. My name is Devon Grob, and I am honored to call Rio Rancho, NM, my home. Currently pursuing my studies in finance at Brigham Young University, I am equally dedicated to my professional endeavors as a member of the esteemed team at Moxie Pest Control. In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am blessed to share my life with my esteemed wife, Lauren, whose presence enriches every aspect of my existence. Together, we are privileged to care for our cherished furry companion, Lylla, who brings endless delight to our home. Throughout this platform, I aim to share insights gleaned from my experiences in finance and pest control, as well as to offer reflections on the joys and challenges of life alongside Lauren and Lylla. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration and value within these digital pages.</li>
